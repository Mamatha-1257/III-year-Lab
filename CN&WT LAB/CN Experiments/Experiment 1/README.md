# Experiment - 1
## Aim of the Experiment
To implement data link layer framing techniques such as 
 
* Character counting
* Character stuffing
* Bit stufffing

## Experiment Procedure

* ### Charatcer counting
  1. The data is taken from the user as normal strings.
  2. In data frame the data frame length is added to the each dataframe at the begining.
  3. After complete data is converted to the data frames it is transmitted to the receiver.
